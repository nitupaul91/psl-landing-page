<div class="section">
  <h4>1) Introduction</h4>
  <p>
    PSL Maxxing (“PSL Maxxing”, “we”, “us”) provides tools that analyze photos and generate appearance-related results,
    including ratings, recommendations, and AI-assisted photo enhancements. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect,
    how we use it, how we share it, and your rights and choices.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h4>2) Information We Collect</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Photos and image content you upload:</strong> images you choose to upload for rating, analysis, and/or AI photo enhancement.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>AI inputs you provide:</strong> selections, settings, instructions, or prompts you submit to generate results.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Outputs and derived data:</strong> ratings, recommendations, measurements/attributes derived from your images,
      and edited/enhanced images generated by the app.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Onboarding / profile information:</strong> information you provide such as gender, birth year, and preferences
      (e.g., goals and style preferences) to personalize your experience.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Usage data:</strong> information about how you use the app (feature usage, interactions, session duration),
      and diagnostic data like crash logs and performance metrics.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Device &amp; technical data:</strong> device model, operating system version, app version, language, and
      approximate location derived from IP address. We do not collect precise GPS location unless you explicitly enable it and we request it.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h4>3) How We Use Your Information</h4>
  <p>We use your information to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Provide the core services:</strong> analyze uploaded photos, generate ratings and recommendations, and create AI-enhanced photo outputs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Personalize your experience:</strong> tailor recommendations using onboarding/profile info and user preferences.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Maintain and improve the app:</strong> monitor performance, fix bugs, analyze feature usage, and improve reliability.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Safety and security:</strong> detect, prevent, and address fraud, abuse, or unauthorized access.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Support and communications:</strong> respond to your requests and send service-related notices (e.g., policy updates).
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h4>4) AI Processing (Including Third-Party AI Providers)</h4>
  <p>
    PSL Maxxing uses automated processing (AI/ML) to provide photo ratings/analysis and AI photo enhancement.
    Depending on the feature you use, your content may be processed by our systems and/or by third-party AI providers
    (for example, AI model hosting/inference services such as Replicate).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What we share with AI providers:</strong> when you use an AI feature, we may share the photo(s) you upload and
    limited information necessary to complete the request (such as chosen settings, instructions, or prompt text).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>How AI providers may use the data:</strong> these providers process the data only to return results to us so we can provide
    the feature to you. We do not authorize third-party AI providers to use your uploaded photos to train or improve their models
    for their own purposes, except where you explicitly consent or where required by law.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Note: third-party providers may retain inputs/outputs for limited periods for abuse prevention, debugging, or legal compliance,
    subject to their terms and our contractual controls.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h4>5) How We Share Information</h4>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>AI service providers:</strong> to run AI features you request (e.g., photo enhancement or analysis) using
      model hosting/inference providers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Other service providers (processors):</strong> vendors that help us operate the app (such as hosting, storage,
      analytics, crash reporting, and customer support). They are permitted to process information only on our behalf and under instructions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Legal and safety:</strong> to comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or to protect the rights,
      safety, and security of users, PSL Maxxing, and the public.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Business transfers:</strong> if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization,
      bankruptcy, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to appropriate safeguards.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h4>6) Data Retention</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Uploaded photos:</strong> we retain photos you upload indefinitely, unless you delete them sooner, in which case we retain them until you delete them or delete your account.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>AI outputs (ratings, recommendations, enhanced images):</strong> we retain outputs for as long as needed to provide the service,
      including displaying your results and history (if supported), unless you delete them sooner.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Onboarding/profile info:</strong> retained while your account is active and deleted or anonymized after account deletion,
      subject to legal requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logs/diagnostics:</strong> retained for a limited period for security, troubleshooting, and product improvement.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Third-party AI providers:</strong> when used, they may retain inputs/outputs for limited periods as described in their terms
      (e.g., for abuse prevention, debugging, and legal compliance).
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h4>7) Security</h4>
  <p>
    We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect your information.
    However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h4>8) Your Rights and Choices</h4>
  <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access</strong> the personal information we hold about you.</li>
    <li><strong>Correct</strong> inaccurate or incomplete information.</li>
